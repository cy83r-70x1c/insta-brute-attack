# auto.sh - InstaHack
#
# The shell / bash script that gives the user the option for automatic password wordlist selections. The tool provides the user with three wordlist files : 1K password file (pass1.txt), 10K password file (pass2.txt) and the 1M passwords file (pass3.txt). Thus, here the user is not required to create a custom wordlist file of passwords like what the user needs to do when using the manual version of this attack.
